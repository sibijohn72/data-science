descriptive
	numerical
		mean and median
	categorical
		mode and frequency table

mean can be represented in histogram
median scatter plot
mode showin in bar chart
freq table in pie chart

Missing Values
	% of missing rows is very less then drop them
	if its numerical replace the missing value with mean
	if its categorical replace with mode : if there is too much mv then this may cause a bias so create new catefory
	replacing with random number : should be valid numbers because regression is affected by outliers
	Predict the values 	

STEPS
Reading data from csv, tsv, sas, txt
Schema
Cleaning
Descriptive - outliers
MV

READING
read.csv(filename)
data.table pppackage use fread

CLEANING
gsub  replace
regexpr like inddex of
substr

DESCRIPTIVE
sumary(data)
gives 5 point summary for numerical



fatcors : ordered or nominal

DATASTRUVTURES
vectors
matrix

hist()
plot()
barplot()



R^2=1-DIFFERENCE IN BESTFIT/DIFFERENCE IN MEAN
variance in modal = difference in mean - ifference in bestfit : this is OLS



generally normal distribution doesnt hold true

critical assumptions
	no correlation btw depenedent
	no autocorrelation



variance of model = variance of mean from actual
variance of error = variance of best fit from actual
MODEL = SST
(SST-SSE)/SST




NULL HYPOTHESIS
